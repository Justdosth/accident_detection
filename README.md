# Accident Casualty Prediction

## Overview
This project involves the development of some regression models to predict [Casualty Severity].

## Dependencies
- Python 3
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is [road-casualty-statistics-casualty-provisional-mid-year-unvalidated-2022.csv]. It contains 61353 observations and 20 features. The target variable is casualty_severity.


## Usage
1. Install the dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
2. open the main Notebook: Accident.ipynb

## Results
The GradientBoostingRegressor model achieved a RMSE value of 0.426602 and R-squared value of 0.073448 on the test set as the Best Model# accident_detection
